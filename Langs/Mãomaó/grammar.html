                <h2>
                    When making sentences in Mãomaó, it's important to follow a SOIAVT structure (subject, object, indirect object, auxiliary, verb, tense). 
                    This is a very strict word order since there are no particles for identifying a subject or object. It's as simple as that.
                </h2>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Nouns and Adjectives and Adverbs</h1>
                <h2>
                    Nouns also have structures, where any possessive pronoun goes after the noun and the number being after the pronoun (if present).
                    when it comes to describing a noun, the adjective goes before the noun. We should also mention that there are no articles in Mãomaó and that adverbs come after the tense marker/verb.
                </h2>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Syllables and writing</h1>
                <h2>
                    Each syllable follows the template N(C)(V)(V); where N is the mandatory nasal consonant "m", C is an optional consonant (e.g. "j" or "r"), and V is an optional vowel ("a", "aa", "ã", "i", or "o").
                    Still will make syllables look like "mr", "mao", "mjaa", "mã", etc; however the combination "oa" and "jr" or "rj" are invalid, making "mjrao" and "mjoa" not possible. Mãomaó also uses tones which are writen with diacritics (see the "language" tab at the top of the page), a list of them can be shown here:
                </h2>
                <h2 class="symbols">á à ǎ a<br>áá àà ǎǎ aa<br>ó ò ǒ o<br>í ì ǐ i</h2>
                <h2>
                    As you can probably tell, ã was not included in the list, this is because it only has a normal flat tone unlike the others.
                </h2>
                <h1 class="subtitle">Conjunctions and particles</h1>
                <h2>
                    Conjunctions and particles come after the second/targeted word or clause, that's kind of it. Examples in literal english would be "him I and" or "I speak I can because".
