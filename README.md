# NewLang
A Website I've Made In order To Show off my Conlangs and Profiles. Not to mention that it's my first successful one (using Nodejs)

For this application/website, you need to have Nodejs and (probably) expressjs installed, instructions provided (mostly for myself) in Main.js.
Use "node Main.js" or "nodemon Main.js" in order to start the server, where there will be a console line explaining on what port/link it's available at.
